# Debugging Talk - Perry Kivolowitz

## Bug Taxonomy

  - Algorithmic/Data Structure
  - Honest Mistake
  - Dumb Shit
    - This happens a lot!

## Motivation

  We all write buggy code, few of us are taught how to debug!

  Some say it can not be taught.

  But the thesis of the talk is:

  > Debugging is based in science, and science can be taught.

## Tips

  Debugging should be methodical not knee-jerk or reactionary

  1. Observe / Gather Data
  2. Formulate Hypothesis
  3. Test hypothesis

  > A fix is not a fix until you completely understand why it is a fix

  Heisenbug - act of looking for the bug, changes the state. lolz

  > Debugging should be about the elimination of unknowns, not their introduction

  > If you make a change with no beneficial result, back it out!*

  > Where the is one there are likely many (You may be seeing a series of unfortunate cascading of errors)

  > Bugs want to be found

  > When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbably, must be the truth!

  > Write in small units. Test in small units.

  > Always play defense. Extra work is finite, Debugging time is not.

  > Testing can only prove the presence of bugs, not their absence

  Edsger Dijkstra

  > Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it

  Donald Knuth

  > Comments help you get back in the zone when returning to previously written code. Comment to explain why you did something, not what you did

  > Write comments before you write your code, you will discover flaws in your algorithm/implementation before you spend the time to code it out
