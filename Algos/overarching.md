#Overarching Lessons from Algos

## Divide and Conquer

Splits the problem up, recursively solves it for each part and then merges them together to get the total solution.

- Often useful for reducing ugly, but still polynomial problems to a more manageable time complexity
- Rarely can be used to drop something from exponential to polynomial

### Examples

- Merge-sort

## Greedy

Do the best possible option at every point and end up with the optimal result.

- Awesome because it is trivial to write
- Not awesome because it usually does not work, it isn't broadly applicable to a wide variety of problem classes

### Examples

- Dijkstra's
- Minimum spanning tree (Prim's, Krustal's, etc.)

## Dynamic Programming
