# The St. Patrick's Day Lecture

Also endangered species

## History

- The term was first coined in order to describe bison
- Implication is that the species is heading for extinction unless we do something
- Introduced legislation in the 60's but all it could do was protect species
- Endangered Species Act of 1973 changed to management and getting the species' off the list


## Who Decides?

- Has become important because the stakes are high for species and society

- Two types of lists
  - Informational  - 'Red Lists' maintained by the IUCN
  - Regulatory - Endangered Species Act of 1973, this is the important one since it carries the weight of law

## 4 Things We Do to Screw Stuff Up

1. Habitat Degradation/Loss
2. Alien Species
3. Pollution
4. Overexploitation

## How To Get On List

- Anyone can petition
- ESA provides specific procedures on how species are to be evaluated
- To get on the candidate list they consider petitions that are backed by credible data
- Species are selected form a candidate list

As a result, some groups try to outlaw putting species on that list

## Stats

- 172 species prevented from extinction
- 90% of species are recovering at the specified rate
- 68% are stable or improving
- Average recovery time of 25 years
- Costs about $1.5 billion / year
- Strong support, 70% of people want it

## What is Done

- If the endangered species population is below K, managers can do a lot!

### Reducing Mortality

- Reduce normal losses
- Control predators, provide food, etc.

Look over specific examples of successes in slides!
