# 4 Fundamental Goals of Wildlife Management

## Human Exploitation

### Overexploitation
Use to much, reduce population.

### Sustainable-Exploitation
Use to match births and deaths

## Key role of Density Dependence

Reductions in population density trigger predictable responses.

It is the **increment of growth** that can be harvested sustainably.

It is equal to r times N

Analogous to endowment that earns interest

Because of slope of Sigmoid graph of population, you can harvest more animals in a sustainable fashion if you do so when the population is in the middle of its Sigmoid graph, where the slope (rate of growth) is higher.

## Essential Information

* N - population size/density
* K - carrying capacity
* r - intrinsic rate of growth

Can use these to figure out curve, and thus how many to harvest.

## Politics

While wildlife managers can figure this stuff out and make suggestions, often times the final decision of numbers to be harvested is decided by someone else such as politicians.

## Math

(rN) Is the key!

rN = dN/dt

rN = increment of growth

##Challenges

* You need to know the numbers for this to work right
* Variability in time period (Natural disaster kills more of population than initially predicted)
* Demand can be greater than sustainable yield from a wild population
* Political and economic pressures often cause decision makers to over harvest
* Poaching
* Can be **ecologically unsustainable** if it disrupts the functioning of the ecosystem

## Which Species can be Harvested Sustainably

The key is regulations.

Regulate the following:

* number of permits available
* the per-hunter take
* where to harvest
* when to harvest
* how long to harvest
* whether to harvest selectively
* how to harvest
