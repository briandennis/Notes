## Overabundance

Is wildlife overabundant? A qualified yes

### Why

1) When animals threaten human life or livelihood
  - aircraft collision
  - property damage
  - damage to crops/livestock
  - transmit deadly diseases
2) When animals depress the abundance of a favored species
3) When animals are too numerous for their own good
4) When animals are causing undesirable changes in the ecosystem

### What to do

- Manipulating mortality, reproduction, emigration
  - requires constant effort
  - many of our pests are r-selected and thus hard to keep at bay
- Relocation or reproductive control
  - expensive
- Alternatives: exclude animals, impose limiting factor, modify behavior
  - Can be effective depending on case
  - Success: barriers, starlings and water feedlots
- Repellants
  - physical can be popular and effective
  - ultrasonic ones are bull
  - chemical repellents, biotic repellents, threats of predation, guard animals

### Bottom Line

There is no cure all. Several of the techniques are expensive or labor intensive. Often control is very controversial.

## Deer

- Have gone from rare to overabundant
- Population began increasing in 1930's after gross over killing in the late 19th century
- Conservation Congress formed in 1933 for citizens to have input on hunting
- By the 1960's there was a clear overabundance
- At that time, innovative methods to deal with issue (sex-age-kill), set density goals on ecological basis
- Still very overabundant, many deer collisions and chronic wasting disease
- Hard to meet management goals since season is too short and people don't want to kill does and fawns
- Scott Walker cut a lot of management resources, greatly put back Wisconsin's policies and removed us from being a leader in management
