## Protected Natural Area

A geographically defined area which is designated to be used for conservation.

Options for protecting intact natural areas are diminishing rapidly. Most will be gone within our lifetime.

## Criteria

Overall central goal is achieving good representation of the world's biodiversity within a network of protected areas

Richness, uniqueness, and naturalness of species and ecosystems
